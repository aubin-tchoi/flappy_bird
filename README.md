# Flappy bird

RL and non-RL algorithms for solving a game of Flappy Bird.

## Tricky parts

- Bars are shuffled (see FlappyBird.observation())
- Inactive bars are kept in the observation
- There are many offsets to take into account precisely
- There are many possible edge cases not discovered yet
